### Introducing the Ultimate Game Trainer, a Versatile and High-Performance Tool for Game Hacking.
#### Features:

Dynamic Code Injection: Our trainer automatically injects code into memory bytes, eliminating the need for pointer addresses. It dynamically obtains new addresses with every game update.
Customizable Hotkey Combinations: Use any combination of hotkeys without limitations, including combinations of more than four keys.
Flexible Memory Management: Configure the trainer for NOP memory bytes or code injection to dynamically obtain addresses. Customize hotkeys for any address according to your preferences.
Comprehensive Teleport Menu: Select a game folder containing specific game coordinates, save and load player positions with unlimited save slots, and manage saved locations in transferable and editable text files.
Dynamic Hotkey Display: The trainer dynamically displays hotkeys in both the GUI menu and the hack menu, adapting seamlessly to any game you choose.
Address and Hotkey Descriptions: Display hotkeys for addresses and their descriptions, providing clarity and ease of use.
Flexible Hotkey Modes: Set hotkeys to hold or toggle based on your requirements.
Process Name Configuration: Write the process name in a text file to use it seamlessly with the trainer.
Automatic Address Updates: The trainer automatically updates byte addresses when the game is updated, removing the need for manual updates.
Note: Users are required to find specific game cheats independently and configure them in the text file. An instructional video will soon be available, demonstrating how to locate the correct bytes for specific addresses in any game and how to use the trainer effectively.

This project represents over five months of dedicated effort. The application will be available for purchase at approximately $50 for a permanent version. Initially, a free 7-day trial will be offered. Additional information and a usage tutorial will be uploaded to YouTube soon.
