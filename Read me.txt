You can use 'Games tables files' for every game without the need for you
to find the game cheat by your self, you can simply copy 'Process_info.in'
to 'Documents\Tettey_trainer\'

You can also copy it along with the folder if the game has saved locations
or you can create the folder for your game there.
You can select the folders in Teleport menu.
And inside that folder you can create 'ini' files. Check the example of
Bully Scholarship table cheat.

Useful tools:

Quick info about 'Process_info.ini' file and trainer mechanism:

Note: When there is a game update, there is a chance that the bytes will change, so if that happens, you will need to update the bytes.

Some games bytes never change or some Opcodes never change depending on the game.

You can make 'search_bytes' as unique as you wish, but make sure the bytes start from your target instruction bytes.

'Original_bytes' represent your target instruction bytes that you want to NOP.

You can change the sections name '[Fly Hack]' ...etc, only don't change the section '[Process Info]', '[Actual Coordinates]', '[Visual Coordinates]'.

Do no add space or any text before or after the sections for example '[Process Info]' So there must be no space or any text.

You can customize your desired hotkeys and the mode to Hold or Toggle.

Set 'Offset1_DisplayInGUI' True to display in GUI, False to hide, do the same for all the offsets.
