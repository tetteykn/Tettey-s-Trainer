You can use 'Games tables files' for every game without the need for you
to find the game cheat by your self, you can simply copy 'Process_info.in'
to 'Documents\Tettey_trainer\'

You can also copy it along with the folder if the game has saved locations
or you can create the folder for your game there.
You can select the folders in Teleport menu.
And inside that folder you can create 'ini' files. Check the example of
Bully Scholarship table cheat.
